# 🚀 Advanced Features Deployment Status

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Syntax Error Fixed

**Problem**: Production deployment failed due to syntax error in `SecurityFraudDetection.js:548`
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
if (this.hasBot ProfilePattern(user.profile)) {

// AFTER (fixed):
if (this.hasBotProfilePattern(user.profile)) {
```
